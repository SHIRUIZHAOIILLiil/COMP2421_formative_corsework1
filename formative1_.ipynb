    "\n",
    "Based on the data in data_pi and figures, Pi is more accurate When the number of iterations is 41st and 43rd which is 3.1415926535897932384626434648637392676053811648806 and accurate to 24 decimal places.At this point the order of magnitude of the absolute error has reached 10 to the -26th power.After this, the error increases gradually at the end of iteration. The accuracy is 50, and during the computation process, especially with multiple iterations, the computer encounters rounding errors when handling floating-point numbers. These rounding errors accumulate with increasing iterations, affecting the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger n is, the more sides a polygon has, and the shorter the side length of a polygon circumscribed around the circle. According to the small side lengths, it becomes difficult to represent the value using ordinary computer floating-point numbers. If I use float64 in numpy library,the calculated value of pi is already 0 at the 26th iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to using the mpmath library, I can set the exact number of floating-point numbers. In this algorithm, I set 50 decimal places after the decimal point. Compared to the numpy library, which the most accurate floating-point type is float64, floating point numbers in the mpmath library can overcome hardware limitations. The mpmath library has some algorithms which can cope with the floating-point numbers generated by itself. "

    "Without changing the precision, the calculated value of pi becomes increasingly accurate until the last round, which is the most precise and can be accurate to 30 decimal places. This value is 3.141592653589793238462643383279729362340591199977. At this point the order of magnitude of the absolute error has reached 10 to the -31th power.\n",
